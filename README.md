# Bar-Tab
Build an open bar

The web-app start with "index.php". Persistent data are in "data" folder. Some test added in "tests" folder ready to use! 
Test Unit in PHPUnit referred to this initial committed persistent data, backup the folder "data" for replacing normal use adjustment of the app before testing PHPUnit with mock data, custom-fit builded.
In my development environment, sometimes, at first server start, I've used to clear browser temp or refresh page for correct istant status.
